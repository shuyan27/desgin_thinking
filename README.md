## Report Reflection

The alignment with successful health apps like MyFitnessPal underscores the validity of our approach in "My Wellness Buddy." The emphasis on video-based workouts resonates with contemporary fitness trends, acknowledging the preference for visual guidance in exercise routines.

The personalized user experiences offered by both MyFitnessPal and "My Wellness Buddy" reflect a commitment to catering to individual fitness goals and preferences. Acknowledging each user's unique journey from the outset is a crucial aspect that enhances the overall effectiveness and relevance of the fitness application.

## Future Direction

The vision for "My Wellness Buddy" revolves around building upon the success of platforms like MyFitnessPal. The focus on enhancing the workout section by incorporating a wider range of video workouts is a strategic move. By expanding the library and refining the user experience, we aim to create a comprehensive fitness application that seamlessly blends personalized guidance with a diverse array of video-based exercises.

## Improvement

In my view, we should enhance this app with more advanced features, such as detecting or measuring users' blood pressure and implementing a glucose checker integrated with hardware (weight measure). This approach will make it more competitive than other existing applications.

In conclusion, the exploration of existing health apps has not only provided valuable insights but has also validated our prototype's direction. The incorporation of unique features and the commitment to continuous improvement position "My Wellness Buddy" as a promising contender in the competitive landscape of fitness applications. As we move forward, the emphasis on user-centric design and the integration of innovative features will be pivotal for the success and growth of the "My Wellness Buddy" platform.
